# Introductory teaching in the relationship between Git & Github
This introduction covers the basics of what Git and GitHub are, the concepts and the basic commands. Bring attention to that the terminology
is different in Git and GitHub.

During teaching Git and the folder we are working in (on our path finder) are both open. This shows that when you fx create a file in Git,
the file now exists on your computer. Likewise, when a file is deleted through Git, it is deleted in from the folder on your computer.
